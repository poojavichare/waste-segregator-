    <p class="af">Organic waste is any material that is biodegradable and comes from either a plant or an animal. Biodegradable waste is organic material that can be broken
    into carbon dioxide, methane or simple organic molecules. Examples of organic waste include green waste, food waste, food-soiled paper, non-hazardous
     wood waste, green waste, and landscape and pruning waste.</p>

      <div class="box"><p class="before">Ways of reusing organic waste</p> <p class="after">There are three main ways in which organic waste can be used:<br>
      	<b>1.Composting</b>:Composting is simply the method of breaking down organic materials in a large container.Composting can convert organic waste into rich, dark coloured compost, or humus, in a matter of a few weeks or months.<br>
      	<b>2.Animal raising</b>:Commercially produced feed for this activity is expensive and pig raisers often turn to organic scraps to supplement or replace the commercial product. Such ventures are beneficial not only to the pig raisers, but also to the municipality who would otherwise have to dispose of the waste in a landfill. <br>
      	<b>3.Source of energy</b>:Biogas is a mixture of methane, CO2 and small quantities of other gases produced by anaerobic digestion of organic matter in an oxygen-free environment.The production of methane for use as a fuel.
